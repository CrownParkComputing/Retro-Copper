/// The emulator core, running INSIDE the launcher process.
///
/// Why this exists: the Android app used to start a second, full-screen
/// Activity for every game, because SDL owns its window and its window owns
/// the screen. Pressing play wiped the launcher, and what came back was a
/// lookalike drawn by a separate Flutter engine.
///
/// The core can run without a window. `gfx_platform_present_frame()` in the
/// fork hands each finished Amiga frame to the platform and, if the platform
/// takes it, SDL never presents -- the libretro build has always worked this
/// way. `host_framebuffer.cpp` implements that tap for this build, so the
/// picture arrives here as pixels and the launcher can draw it in a panel
/// beside its own chrome, on one screen. SDL's video driver is set to
/// `offscreen` so SDL_Init needs no Activity and no surface.
///
/// The core's own entry point never returns, so it runs on its own isolate --
/// which on the Dart side means its own thread. Everything else here is a
/// plain call from the UI isolate: the frame buffer and the host API live in
/// process memory, which both isolates share.
